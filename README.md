This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

You can also use other package managers, but this project is configured for Bun:

```bash
# Alternative package managers (not recommended for this project)
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Using Bun

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the preferred JavaScript runtime and package manager. Here are some common commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Add a new dependency
bun add [package-name]

# Add a development dependency
bun add -d [package-name]

# Run scripts defined in package.json
bun run [script-name]

# Run TypeScript/JavaScript files directly
bun [file.ts]
```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
